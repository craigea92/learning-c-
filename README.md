# learning-csharp

The C# programming language allows you to build many types of applications, like:

Business applications to capture, analyze, and process data
Dynamic web applications that can be accessed from a web browser
Games, both 2D and 3D
Financial and scientific applications
Cloud-based applications
Mobile applications
But how do you begin to write an application?

Applications are all made up of many lines of code that work together to achieve a task. By far, the best way to learn how to code is to write code. It's encouraged that you write code along with the exercises in this module and the others in this learning path. Writing code yourself in each exercise and solving small coding challenges will accelerate your learning.

You'll also begin learning small foundational concepts and build on them with continual practice and exploration.
